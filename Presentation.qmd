## Some Important Literature

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes a
con­nection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calcu-
lus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral calculus arose
from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s mentor at Cambridge,
Isaac Barrow (1630–1677)[@stewart2016biocalculus]


## example

$$\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin(t) \cos(t)}{\sqrt{\sin^2(t) + 25}}\ , dt$$
